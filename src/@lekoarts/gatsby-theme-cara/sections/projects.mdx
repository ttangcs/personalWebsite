This is my senior capstone project, currently still a work in progress. Although a work in progress I had learned how to solve problems that I ran into, as Swift was a relatively new language for me. To develop effective problem solving skills, this taught me how to overcome the roadblocks of dataflow issues that I had ran into. I had decided to jump into SwiftUI which is Apple's development interface toolkit. When creating the app I had started get very large views, as I learned more I understood that I had to implement the structures that were provided and made my own models and views. To attain a system-level understanding of the computer, one of the goals set by the computer science department at Westminster although I wasn't able to implement my printing system for my application it had taught me at a lower level from the computer. In my case the iPad many of the printers SDKs were written in C++ so I had to understand what was going on at the lower level of both pieces of hardware. To understand the concepts and techniques of software design, I had to learn the difference between each toolkit which made a huge difference on my understanding of programming languauges. To acquire significant project experience working both individually and in a group setting, I had a lot of exposure to doing a project by myself it allowed me to learn everything from the base up.

This is a personal project that I have recently started with a couple of friends, as of right now the repository is currently private because me and my friends have agreed that this may be something that we may want to publish. Please contact me if you want to view the repository.

A website that I and my friend Cole am working on for my parents for their restaraunt. It currently uses Firebase firestore as its database, although GatsbyJS is a statically rendered we still pull from the database when we are building the website. The plans are to convert it to a server side rendered page (Next.js) or client side rendered(create-react-app), adding a login page so that the database can be editted, than integratting a api from my point of sale system to place orders online.

<ProjectCard title="Linux Project - Todo" link="https://github.com/ttangcs/linuxProject" bg="linear-gradient(to right, #bdc3c7 0%, #2c3e50 100%)">
I chose this project out of the projects/assignments that I have had at westminster because, this project allowed me to understand how a lot of scripts work. When I first started to program I would regularly just copy and paste a command without a understanding of what was the command doing. So now I have a better understanding of how we can use scripts to have the computer do certain actions that we wish it also has made a few things easier as I can now run a command and it will do the commands that I desired.

<ProjectCard title="Eight Puzzle" link="https://github.com/ttangcs/Eight-Puzzle" bg="linear-gradient(to right, #ffd89b 0%, #19547b 100%)">
This assignment was significant now that I have been out of the class I realized that it has had me do some critical thinking. While doing this assignment I learned that writing down what I think the solution would be resulted in running into less problems majority of the time. This allowed for me to plan what I needed to do, I started to write pseudo-code much more often after finishing this assignment.

<ProjectCard title="Sleeping TA" link="https://github.com/ttangcs/Sleeping-TA" bg="linear-gradient(to right, #ff512f 0%, #dd2476 100%)">
Sleeping TA, a very recent assignment that I had to do. I chose this because I found that this actually was super helpful it helped me understand at a lower level what is going on. This played a even bigger role while doing my capstone because although it was later in the semester this allowed me to understand the ways that ASync was causing problems when retrieving data, so Mutex locks became one of the most useful things I have used, fixing a bunch of problems that I had.

<ProjectCard title="UHLC" link="https://github.com/ttangcs/UHLC-Full" bg="linear-gradient(to right, #ba5370 0%, #f4e2d8 100%)">
Although this project had not been published because of me and my groups busy schedule this was one of the biggest learning experience in terms of working in a group. There were so many other components to this project that I had not realized that played such an important role. Spending time with other people that were not in my major or same interest taught me that I needed to learn how to solve problems with someone else that doesn't understand what I understand at the same level, vice a versa.

<ProjectCard title="BitMap - Image Alteration" link="https://github.com/ttangcs/BitMap" bg="linear-gradient(to right, #4ca1af 0%, #c4e0e5 100%)">
Although this was one of the most difficult assignements in my semester of CMPT 251. It showed me that understanding the base of a structure helps with understanding the goal of something. When I initially started this assignment I just assumed that I knew what to do and just continued to program. After trying to run the program, I thought that it was just a small bug, because the program wouldn't enlarge the image and I couldn't figure it out until I spent the time understanding the BitMap
